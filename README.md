BİLGE (Türkçe Bilgi ve İdrak Eğitimi) is a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. It addresses the gap in resources for assessing Turkish language understanding and factual knowledge. BİLGE includes diverse categories, mainly STEM, literature, history, geography, and philosophy, utilizing multiple-choice questions to challenge LLMs. BİLGE introduces elements such as intentionally badly-typed questions and common misconceptions to test model robustness.
